# APL for Audio Template

This template is built on top of Node.js SDK. It's pretty simple, as on this demo i have demonstrated the Audio functionality in APL that uses APL multi child components, with filters. 

### Using this skill template

1. If you don't have one already, create an [Amazon Developer account](https://developer.amazon.com/).

2. Click the button below to deploy the code for this skill into your Alexa developer account.

   <Badge_Here>

3. In the Alexa developer console, set the skill's invocation name.

4. Test the skill with an Alexa device that supports APL.

   > **NOTE:** You can test the skill in devices like: Echo Show, Fire TV, some Fire tablets, and other devices.

5. Modify the skill code to use your own music/audio URL

**NOTE:**

1. Make sure you format your audio files properly with SSML standard protocols & upload them to your s3 hosted skill bucket. If you are not sure about audio formatting, you can check this [here](https://github.com/dabblelab/dabble-alexa-with-sohini/blob/main/E03-alexa-skill-using-audio-files/Audio%20Formatting%20with%20Audacity.md) for Audacity. And using FFMPEG, you can do the same, check this out [here](https://github.com/dabblelab/dabble-alexa-with-sohini/blob/main/E03-alexa-skill-using-audio-files/Audio%20Formatting%20with%20FFMPEG.md) Try to name the audio files without spaces in them inorder to prevent errors. 
2. I have some formatted audio files in the Assets Folder, you may use them for your reference/testing.

UPDATE: Code Cleaned and multiple APL child audio components are added to the APL-A document.
